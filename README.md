# Requires [LiteLoader](http://liteloader.com) 1.8!
Also requires latest [LLCore](https://github.com/MrSpring/LLCore) in order to run in development environments. If you are playing with the mod you don't need LLCore, it is build into the downloaded .litemod file.

The in-game file explorer mod allows you to look around your systems file, and view/edit some file types.
These include:  
* .txt - The mod has a built in text-editor for text files. Files can be viewed, edited and saved without having to leave the game (WIP)!
* .png/.jpeg - The mod also include an image viewer!
* .json - The mod includes a simple-to-use in-game JSON editor (WIP)!

The mod has been tested on Windows and Linux. It may or may not work on Mac. If you try this on a Mac, then please tell me how it goes (If it crashes, send me the crashlog).
