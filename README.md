# Requires LiteLoader 1.8 to run!

The in-game file explorer mod allows you to look around your systems file, and view/edit some file types.
These include:  
* .txt - The mod has a built in text-editor for text files. Files can be viewed, edited and saved without having to leave the game!
* .png/.jpeg - The mod also include an image viewer!
* .json - The mod includes a simple-to-use in-game JSON editor (WIP)!
